# Unorganized NFTs/Gamify Design
- Mint NFTs (Wolverines which can breed)
  - Have traits
- be able to create NFTs and upload to the wolvercoin network (have a variable for NFT contract address and later 
  - upload NFTs and pay for them with wolvercoin**
  - create prize pools for initial activity on the wolvercoin platform
  - tax creators to prevent nft actions (creation, but, sell, trade)
- host NFT competition periodically
  - secret theme chosen and matching nft  
- usable in the caf through purchasable NFTs
- Virtual slot machine and modded by a number. 85% actual return, with tiers
# Design
- Create a 3rd Coin:
  - For user-created items
  - For each NFT a user mints, they get a small amount of GAME coin when their NFT is purchased by another user which equals a percentage of the NFT’s value
  - GAME coin can be used to artificially increase an NFT’s value when it is created
